## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
You create a repository by forking or just creating new, from there you can clone to your local machine (by using "git clone ...") in the command line.

- Describe what open source means.
OpenSource meens that you allow you code to be exposed to others to use, edit or change.

- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Its great, imo. It enables people to easier build on others work and make cooler stuff!

- Assess the importance of using licenses.
It is important to choose the right licence so you are aware of what people are allowed to do with your work.

- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
It is clear to me now how to commit and update git/github. I ams still struggling to update my local files without having to try a few things. I think an "aha" is how easy GitHub makes the process of checking in code.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Not really, just used the directions that were listed. I have had expeience with Github in the past.
