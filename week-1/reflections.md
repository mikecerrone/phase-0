#1.1 Think About Time

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about? The Pomodoro technique
What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0? Time boxing is setting a time to work on something rather than working on something until the goal is accomplished. I can use this technique with answering the reflection sections of the challenges!
How do you manage your time currently? I use a to-do list and swag out time frames for tasks. From there I put everything in my cal and get to work.
Is your current strategy working? If not, why not? For the most part, yes. I like the feeling of getting things done so having 3-5 tasks to complete a day usually works. I am always open to learning ways to improve such as the pomodoro technique within tasks and meditation to stay sharp!
Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how? I would like to start a daily meditation practice. I signed up for headspace.com
What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management? I plan on taking a look at the weeks tasks and breaking them out into smaller chunks and scheduling them throughout the week.

#1.2 The Command Line


What is a shell? What is "bash?"A shell is a command line interpreter which gives you access to processing power without a GUI. Bash is a command line language used in the shell.
What was the most challenging for you in going through this material? Remembering all the commands. I found them not to be very intuitive.
Were you able to successfully use all of the commands? Not all the commands! There are a ton of them, but I was able to use the common ones (most of the ones listed below).
In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know? ls, cd, pwd because they are key to navigating much like the GUI that we are use to...
Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd - Prints what directory / file you are currently in.

-ls - list all files in the current directory

-mv - Rename or move files

-cd - change directory

-../ - go up one directory

-touch - tells you the last time a file was modified or created

-mkdir - Creates a directory

-less - Allows you to view text one page at a time

-rmdir - Removes a directory

-rm - removes an object

-help - shows all the commands or helps you search through help files


#1.4 Forking and Cloning

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one? They would be step by step instructions similar to what was presented in DBC but they would include some of the potential errors that a user could encounter. You would fork a repository so you can pick up where the last team has left off.
What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process? I got an error and this took quite some time... I am not authenticating so I needed to create a new SSH key. My porcess consisted of pasting the error into google and finding the right help page within github and following the steps to create a new SSH key and then pairing with my github account. It was quite a process but feel good about solving the problem.
