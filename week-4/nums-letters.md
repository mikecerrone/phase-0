What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Integer division always rounds down where float division does not round.



```ruby
--#1--
def yearHours
  +(24*7)*52
  end

puts yearHours

--#2--
def decHours
  +((24*7)*52)*10
  end

  puts decHours

```

What is the difference between integer and float division?

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
--A variable is a place to store data. Each variable is given a unique name. Variables hold objects. The scope of a local variable ranges from class, module, def, or do to the corresponding end or brackets.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
I was surprised how many things I forgot. The challenge took way longer than I thought it would because I skipped over a few things and then when I got stuck had to double back. Lesson learned!
