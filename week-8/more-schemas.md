REFLECTION:

What is a one-to-one database?
-- One-to-one relationships are used when two things have a single relationship to one another.
When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
What is a many-to-many database?
-- A many-to-many relationship/database is when a there can be multiple instances of the relationship.
When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
-- I would use a many to many relationship when associating users and accounts. there are multiple users and a user could have multiple accounts (different permissions levels etc)
What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
-- There are a few confusing things... I am a bit confused by the join table but think that if I get some experience using it, things will make sense. I think theoretically things make sense but its hard to actually think of examples since the concepts are new.
