<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
it was cool. I thought the solo challange felt like more creative since we were creating our own site.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I researched the <hr> element and had to try a few things before I was able to find the correct elelment.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I am trying to be mindful of best practices as well as commenting my code.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
html seems to be limited since its a markup language. I am excited to learn CSS next.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Not sure I have any "tricks" a this point. Would love to hear what other people have for tricks ;)
