What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
-- We got stuck here because the files we not in the same directory. I think its important to have them both in the same directory!


What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
--It was dificult for us. We ended up creating classes to group positioning tasks like ".center" I found it suprisingly difficult to do relativly simple positioning tasks. I think the issue was that there are so many ways to do the same thing.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
--We used "font-size" to modify the font size, "color" to change text color and "column" to create columns.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
--We did, We decided to use classes inside of divs to position as well as classes within font tags to specifiy letter sizes.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
--I think we use CSS in a better way than Birkshire since they style in-line. Our site still has spacing issues that we were not able to tackle in this challange. I would still rather have the Birkshire site at this point, but we are getting closer!
