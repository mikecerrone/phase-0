How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
Right click in the browser and "inspect element"

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
by using height and width

What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult? using relative seemed to be the most flexable for postioning.
Static - Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow
Absolute - The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element
Fixed - The element is positioned relative to the browser window
Relative - The element is positioned relative to its normal position


What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
Margin is the outter most section border is the middle element and padding is within the element


What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
It was pretty challanging because we had to try many different combinations to complete the challanges.I feel like this is what it would be like to complete a project with CSS. I can imagine it being very frustrating when the CSS gets more complicated.
